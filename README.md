# Week 1 Toy Problems

My repository contains solutions to the toy problems for Week 1 of the JavaScript course.

## Challenges:

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This function prompts the user for marks (0 to 100) and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following ranges:
- A: 79 and above
- B: 60 to 79
- C: 49 to 59
- D: 40 to 49
- E: Below 40

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This program checks the speed of a car and calculates demerit points based on the speed:
- If the speed is under 70, it prints "Ok".
- For every 5 km/h above 70, it adds a demerit point.
- If the points exceed 12, the license is suspended.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This program calculates the net salary by considering basic salary, benefits, tax (PAYE), NHIF, and NSSF deductions.
